# PaymentProcessingApp
#### By Fergus Haak - 13/12/2022 
A payment processing app is a software application that facilitates the transaction of funds between a payer and a payee. The app allows users to securely enter their payment information, such as credit card or bank account details, and transmit it to the appropriate financial institution for processing. The app then facilitates the transfer of funds from the payer's account to the payee's account, completing the transaction. Payment processing apps can be used for a variety of purposes, such as making online purchases, paying bills, or sending money to friends and family. These apps often offer additional features, such as the ability to track and manage transactions, set up automatic payments, and receive notifications of account activity.

### Information

This application was created to practise programming in an object-oriented style, it simulates how different areas of the program might work together. However this app does not have any actual functionality and doesnt interact with actual banks or real money. This is purely an example of a payment processing applcations layout. It might eventually feature a GUI and be used as an example app prototype.

### Requirements
- Submit Payment for processing
- Check status of payment
- Canceling a payment
- Refunding a payment
- Handling authentication
- Authorizing access to payment information
- Store sensitive information
- Transmitting sensitive payment data

### Stages
1. Authorization: This is the first step in the payment process, where the payment processor sends a request to the customer's bank to verify that the funds are available and that the customer's account is in good standing.
2. Capture: After the payment has been authorized, the merchant can "capture" the funds, which means they are requesting the funds to be transferred from the customer's account to the merchant's account.
3. Clearing and Settlement: After the funds have been captured, they are transferred from the customer's bank to the merchant's bank through a process known as clearing and settlement. This typically involves the payment processor and the merchant's acquiring bank, and may involve other intermediaries as well.
4. Funding: Once the funds have been transferred from the customer's bank to the merchant's bank, they are typically available for the merchant to use, either by being deposited into the merchant's account or made available for use through a line of credit.
5. Reconciliation: After the payment has been processed, the merchant and the payment processor will typically reconcile the transaction to ensure that everything was handled correctly and that the correct funds were transferred. This may involve comparing transaction records and identifying any discrepancies that need to be resolved.
